Welcome to my AI Learning Roadmap! I created this based on my own journey—building projects, getting stuck, learning from mistakes, and sharing what’s actually useful. This started as something for my personal use, but it’s grown into a resource for anyone hungry to break into AI, whether you’re a student, a mid-career dev, a maker, or just curious about artificial intelligence.

### ✅ Guiding Principles

- **For everyone**: If you have basic math and coding, you’ll find a path here. No advanced degree needed—just willingness to learn.
- **Free & open**: Every resource is free and open for anyone. All you need is internet access and some curiosity.
- **Step-by-step, but flexible**: I organized this in a way that helps most people, but feel free to skip ahead or backtrack as you go.
- **Practical focus**: Instead of endless theory, this guide sticks to what you truly need for real projects and understanding—90% impact, less busywork.
- **Community powered**: Learning is way better (and more fun) together. Consider joining our Discord or any active ML community.
- **Always up to date**: I regularly add new courses, tools, and project ideas as AI keeps growing.

> 🛠 Building, tinkering, and learning actively is the heart of this journey. Dive in, start small, build things, and share your wins and struggles.
